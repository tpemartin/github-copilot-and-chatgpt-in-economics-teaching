# 基礎賽局理論

## 博弈、策略、收益等概念

In game theory, a game is a mathematical model of an interactive situation in which two or more **players** choose **strategies** that maximize their **payoffs** at the expense 
of the other players. More formally, a game is a mathematical model of a situation in which agents choose strategies and receive payoffs, where the payoff of each
agent depends only on the strategies chosen by the other agents.

For example, consider the following so called prisoner's dilemma game:
  * player 1 can choose to cooperate (C) or defect (D)
  * player 2 can choose to cooperate (C) or defect (D)
  * the payoff matrix is given by

  |     | C    | D    |
  | --- | ---- | ---- |
  | C   | 3, 3 | 0, 5 |
  | D   | 5, 0 | 1, 1 |

In this example, the strategies are cooperate (C) or defect (D). The payoffs are given by the numbers in the payoff matrix. For example, if player 1 chooses to cooperate (C) and player 2 chooses to defect (D), then player 1 gets 0 and player 2 gets 5.

## Nash equilibrium

A Nash equilibrium is a pair of strategies, one for each player, such that each strategy is a best response to the other strategy. In other words, if both players play their Nash equilibrium strategies, then neither player can benefit by changing their strategy while the other player keeps their strategy unchanged.

## Nashpy module

In python, we can model the above game and solve for its Nash equilibrium using the Nashpy module. First, we need to install the Nashpy module. To do this, open the command prompt and type the following command.

    pip install nashpy


The following code shows how to do this.

```python  
import nashpy as nash

A = [[3, 0], [5, 1]]
B = [[3, 5], [0, 1]]

prisoner_dilemma = nash.Game(A, B)
equilibria = prisoner_dilemma.support_enumeration()
for eq in equilibria:
    print(eq)

```

  * The first line imports the Nashpy module.
  * The second and third lines define the payoff matrices for the two players.
  * The fourth line creates a game object.
  * The fifth line solves for the Nash equilibria.

> To see one solution in `equilibria` your can run:

```python
print(first(equilibria))
```

The output of the above code is
    
    ```
    (array([1., 0.]), array([1., 0.]))
    (array([0., 1.]), array([0., 1.]))
    (array([0.5, 0.5]), array([0.5, 0.5]))
    ```
* The first line of the output means that if player 1 chooses to cooperate (C) and player 2 chooses to cooperate (C), then neither player can benefit by changing their strategy while the other player keeps their strategy unchanged.
* The second line of the output means that if player 1 chooses to defect (D) and player 2 chooses to defect (D), then neither player can benefit by changing their strategy while the other player keeps their strategy unchanged.
* The third line of the output means that if player 1 chooses to choose either cooperate (C) or defect (D) with equal probability and player 2 chooses to choose either cooperate (C) or defect (D) with equal probability, then neither player can benefit by changing their strategy while the other player keeps their strategy unchanged.

## Class

In the previous example, we have two players, player 1 and player 2. Each player has two strategies, cooperate (C) or defect (D).

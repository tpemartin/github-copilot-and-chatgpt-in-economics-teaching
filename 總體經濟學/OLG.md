# Overlapping Generation Model

## Model
In the Overlapping Generation Model (OLG), we assume that 
* there are two generations: young and old
* the young generation works and consumes
* the old generation does not work and consumes
* the young generation becomes the old generation in the next period
* the old generation dies in the next period

We can model this economy as follows:
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \max_{c_1, c_2} u(c_1) + \beta u(c_2) \\
& \text{s.t.} \\
& c_1 + s = w \\
& c_2 = (1 + r) s \\
& c_1, c_2, s \geq 0
\end{aligned}
$$
where $c_1$ is the consumption of the young generation, $c_2$ is the consumption of the old generation, $s$ is the saving of the young generation, $w$ is the wage rate, $r$ is the interest rate, and $\beta$ is the discount factor.
